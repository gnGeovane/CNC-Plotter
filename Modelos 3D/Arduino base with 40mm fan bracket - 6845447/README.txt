Arduino base with 40mm fan bracket by thrly on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6845447

Summary:
An alternative for Andrew Sleigh's brilliant pen plotter (mk.3) arduino/cnc shield box. This is a much quicker print, and leaves the boards open with space for heatsinks and a side bracket for mounting a small 40mm fan. (The fan just runs straight off the 5V/GND pins on the CNC shield).Fan bracket takes M3 bolts/nuts.Details: https://github.com/thrly/plotter
